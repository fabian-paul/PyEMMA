Jupyter notebook tutorials
==========================

By means of three different application examples, these notebooks give an overview of following methods:

   * Featurization and MD trajectory input
   * Time-lagged independent component analysis (TICA)
   * Clustering
   * Markov state model (MSM) estimation and validation
   * Computing Metastable states and structures, coarse-grained MSMs
   * Hidden Markov Models (HMM)
   * Transition Path Theory (TPT)

These tutorials are part of a (not yet published) LiveCOMS journal article and are up to date with the state of the
released version of PyEMMA. You can file issues and pull requests for the contents of both the article and the
jupyter notebooks `here <https://github.com/markovmodel/PyEMMA_tutorials>`_.
